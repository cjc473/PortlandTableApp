* Restaurant View
  
PortlandTable opens to a splash page of restaurants sorted by category. Users can gauge their interest in restaurants based on their photo, cuisine, price, and neighborhood. From the splash page, users can navigate to individual restaurant show pages to see additional details and create a reservation.
